-Prehaps it would be more stable if you compute Pw for state along with conditional Pw for each move, that way you can simply back up state Pw
-instead of conditional Pw for each move maybe just use a fractional amount of the state win probability without enforcing any statistical interpretation (but how would this be expected to converge correctly?, possible danger of state win just converging to 1 and each move probability capturing all the variability)
